Project's Title: "YARO Assignment"

Project's Description: In this project, I have created 2 APIs, one for user registration and another to check user by mobile number.

Approach:

--I have created an index file, in which I have imported express framework, body-parser for parsing request body and dotenv for securing important keys.
--I have used express routing to create a mini-app, named route, in which i have created both API.
--User controller has two handlers where business logic is kept. User can register as well as check any user available with given mobile number.
--To validate each field of request headers, I have imported validator functions from helper module of utility directory.
